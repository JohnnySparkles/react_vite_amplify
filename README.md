# React + Vite + Amplify starter
This is a starter package for doing React + Vite + Amplify. It is setup with all the things you need to develop, test, and deploy a React + Vite + Amplify project.

# Usage:
Clone the package with git clone. If you run the tests the integration tests should fail until you have configured an amplify project.


# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
